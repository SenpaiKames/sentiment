2171,"i rly hope we come up with vaccines that are safe for kids, especially students.

ang hirap hirap mag-aral ng online. it's not just abt absorbing the lessons that make it difficult. ang lala din ng isolation. there is no sense of community in online classes."
2172,"Then you want ched online classes???????? You can study online, let's see if you can handle it. I have my own room and i have gadgets but this setup aint for me, HOW ABOUT THE STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT AS PRIVILEGED AS ME????? IT'S WORSE FOR THEM."
2173,"On the other side, those who are sitting are just sitting inside the house...complete resources, parents can provide their needs...they are still complaining😪

In my POV? All students can study even online, it's difficult, but so... let's inspire and help each other this time"
2174,It's boring to study even if it's an online class.
2175,I don't want to study online class again

2177,"I was considering not to study again while the classes are still online. Now, if I go through with that plan, I might never be able to study again😂"
2178,"I think it's more comfortable to study online because at least I don't have to commute to school, but it's more tiring than cramming in lrt!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2179,I have no other choice but to study online class next year
2180,"Yup! And don't pressure the student to study harder, because even in f2f there are a lot of learning lapses, is it still 'flexible' learning online?"
2181,"In addition to the lack of resources to keep up with the online methods of the class for the poor, it drains motivation and essence to study at home which, after all, cannot be considered a ""conducive learning environment"". Because of this, various problems with"

2185,what online class again next school year? I don't want to study Potangina
2186,"Actually, it is very difficult to study online. Special mention is the med. Those essential skills, patient interactions... all gone. Imagine, you will do the physical exam with a stuffed toy? Is there something to palpate? Auscultate? Percussion? Nothing. Really sad 😖"
2187,It's legit that I can't study online class next school year
2188,"Intensifying the use of Modules and Online Classes has become part of Flexible Learning because we are not allowed to go out, we study at home. The concept of flexible learning covers even if you are in another country/area and you want to study in that country/area, you can study."
2189,"try to do online learning quickly because you don't have stable internet, you have a lot of household chores to do, your surroundings are noisy, you don't have a study space, you don't have any gadgets, you're not used to studying alone. PLS TRY IT"
2190,"Very relatable.

One of the reasons why I decided to take law school next year is because of the class setup. It's very difficult to study Law—after all, if it's online, it might be triple the difficulty. I said maybe next year it can be f2f. After all, CHED doesn't want it."
2191,Ched naman jusko feel sorry for myself I'm stupid this school year is all online class then next school year it's online class again.. nyemas don't study
2192,I don't want to study online I'm just a cock 🤣🤣🤣🤣#LigtasNaBalikEskwela https://t.co/zOqABS9ebJ
2193,"Sorry CHED but I don't think the online class or what you call flexible learning is effective, you don't see the effect it has on the students, it's boring to study, the students are unmotivated.... So I hope you think carefully about your decisions"
2194,"to be honest, I'm torn from f2f classes lolz I want to do f2f because the cases are terrible huhu I don't want to risk because I don't learn online so what's the answer to this? don't study jk HAHAHA I don't know what to do 🤡"
2195,"CHED, that's why students persisted in online class so they wouldn't be caught incase they did ftf suddenly, then now it's rumored that flexible learning will be normalized?? no one wants to study anymore"
2196,"Me too 🥲 besides, it's a waste of 20/20 vision if it gets damaged due to online class

When this gang continues in 2022, I might consider another field or study instead of rotting in our house 😅😆"
2197,"If the online class is forever, just study. I don't want anymore. I am tired."
2198,Yoko to study next school year if online fvckin class will still happen 🙂
2199,"they said it's not because there's a graduate, the online class is working, what about the students who fail? have you ever thought about their reasons? Or even see what they are going through? It's hard to study when the education system is not in order tbh #LigtasNaBalikEskwela"
2200,What is CHED? CE subjects are hard to study online so will it continue? song laziness to study.
2201,"My brother doesn't want to study in one year if it's still online 😂 I want to study because I didn't learn anything in the online class and we won't have anything to study, CHED."
2202,Let's hope you're ched so you can study online #LigtasNaBalikEskwela
2203,"tangina be trending because of ched's stupidity 😭

well-deserved, please i just wanna experience college face to face, online classes suck, kayo kaya mag-aral 🙄"
2204,"I think it is still possible to bring back f2f while still keeping some facilities online classes had. But of course at the end of the day I'm not sure if you're thinking about the actual students, so just study. #LigtasNaBalikEskwela"
2205,"don't even study if it's only online classes, you don't learn anything, you just pass :))"

2209,Online class is so tiring. How long do we have to make you understand? Is the online class still a push? Just study so that you too can experience the hardship.
2210,"CHED online class is for the privilege only. What about the others who want to study but don't have gadgets, wifi or data load??? So they will be more forced to stop and wait for the pandemic to end before they can go back to school. Did you do research???"
2211,"even my parents are asking me if f2f classes will come back, and I still say ""I don't know"" and then it will open? have mercy hey we don't have the motivation to study anymore, don't be surprised if many students go crazy because of these online classes."
2212,The online class will never be normal especially when the students are not learning anything. Umay. I don't want to study.
2213,CHED doesn't really know how hard to us students the module/online learning....... kayo nalang mag-aral grrr!!!
2214,"I'm tired of the online class and it hurts to hear that CHED still has no plans for #LigtasNaBalikEskwela,, I want to study hard because to be tbh I'm not learning anything (if there is anything, it's only minimal) in our online class ,, LET IT BE YOUR FAULT!!!"
2215,I don't want to study if it's still online classes 😭😭😭

2217,"flexible online learning will be the new norm amp, try it so you can study for yourself. maybe you guys won't finish even one semester."
2218,"you hate CHED. this decision only shows how incompetent this government is. that's how you envision the ph, there is no target date when it is possible to go back to school safely.

the one you will bribe, study online so you know he is not ideal in many aspects. STUPID."

2222,"If it's only an online class again next sem, just don't study. Let the latin honor go instead of me being madly facing the cell phone and far from real learning."
